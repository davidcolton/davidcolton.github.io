      <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A little over a year ago I complete the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science">IBM Data Science Professional Certificate</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a summary / overview of the course if anyone is interested. Most of the content of this post is a summary of the details available at the link above.</p>
<p>And for anyone interested, here is a link to the Capstone Project I submitted to complete this course:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://davidcolton.github.io/Coursera_Capstone/">Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Why this course was created</h2>
<p>Data is collected in every aspect of our existence. The true transformative impact of data is realizable only when we can mine and act upon the insights contained within the data. Thus it is no surprise to see phrases such as “data is the new oil” (Economist).</p>
<p>A variety of data related professions are relevant: Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Database Developer, Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst, etc., and the most prominent of those is Data Scientist. It has been called “the sexiest job of the 21st century” by the Harvard Business Review, and Glassdoor calls it the “best job in America”. </p>
<p>In a recent report, IBM projected that “by 2020 the number of positions for data and analytics talent in the United States will increase by 364,000 openings, to 2,720,000”. The global demand is even higher.</p>
<h2>What is been offered</h2>
<p>It consists of 9 courses that are intended to arm you with latest job-ready skills and techniques in Data Science. </p>
<p>The courses cover variety of data science topics including: open source tools and libraries, methodologies, Python, databases and SQL, data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning. You will practice hands-on in the IBM Cloud (at no additional cost) using real data science tools and real-world data sets.</p>
<h2>How is it different</h2>
<p>This professional certificate has a strong emphasis on applied learning. Except for the first course, all other courses include a series of hands-on labs and are performed in the IBM Cloud (without any cost to you). </p>
<p>Throughout this Professional Certificate you are exposed to a series of tools, libraries, cloud services, datasets, algorithms, assignments and projects that will provide you with practical skills with applicability to real jobs that employers value, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Jupyter / JupyterLab, Zeppelin notebooks, R Studio, Watson Studio, Db2 database</li>
<li><strong>Libraries:</strong> Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Projects:</strong> random album generator, predict housing prices, best classifier model, battle of neighbourhoods</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who this is for</h2>
<p>Data Science is for everyone – not just those with a Master’s or Ph.D. Anyone can become a Data Scientist, whether or not you currently have computer science or programming skills. It is suitable for those entering the workforce as well as for existing professionals looking to upskill / re-skill themselves and get ahead in their careers. </p>
<p>A Data Scientist is someone who can find the right data, prepare it, analyse and visualize data using a variety of tools and algorithms, build data experiments and models, run these experiments, learn from them, adjust and re-iterate as needed, and eventually be able to tell the story hidden within data so it can be acted upon – either by a human or a machine.</p>
<h2>Cost and duration</h2>
<p>The courses in this certificate are offered online for self-learning and available for “audit” at no cost. “Auditing” a course gives you the ability to access all lectures, readings, labs, and non-graded assignments at no charge. If you want to learn and develop skills you can audit all the courses for free [do this first to get as much free as possible].</p>
<p>The graded quizzes, assignments, and verified certificates are only available with a low-cost monthly subscription (it was just $39 USD per month for a limited time). </p>
<p>The certificate requires completion of 9 courses. Each course typically contains 3-6 modules with an average effort of 2 to 4 hours per module. If learning part-time (e.g. 1 module per week), it would take 6 to 12 months to complete the entire certificate. If learning full-time (e.g. 1 module per day) the certificate can be completed in 2 to 3 months.</p>

<h1>Applied Data Science Capstone</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this module, you will learn about the scope of this capstone course and the context of the project that you will be working on. You will learn about different location data providers and what location data is normally composed of. Finally, you will be required to submit a link to a new repository on your Github account dedicated to this course.</p>
<h2>Foursquare API</h2>
<p>In this module, you will learn in details about Foursquare, which is the location data provider we will be using in this course, and its API. Essentially, you will learn how to create a Foursquare developer account, and use your credentials to search for nearby venues of a specific type, explore a particular venue, and search for trending venues around a location.</p>
<h2>Neighbourhood Segmentation and Clustering</h2>
<p>In this module, you will learn about k-means clustering, which is a form of unsupervised learning. Then you will use clustering and the Foursquare API to segment and cluster the neighbourhoods in the city of New York. Furthermore, you will learn how to scrape website and parse HTML code using the Python package Beautiful Soup, and convert data into a pandas data frame.</p>
<h2>The Battle of Neighbourhoods</h2>
<p>In this module, you will start working on the capstone project. You will clearly define a problem and discuss the data that you will be using to solve the problem.</p>
<p>You will then carry out all the remaining work to complete your capstone project. You will submit a report of your project for peer evaluation.</p>
<h2>Applied Data Science Capstone Part 1 [Week 1]</h2>
<p>Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.</p>
<p>This submission will eventually become your Introduction / Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.</p>
<h2>Applied Data Science Capstone Part 2 [Week 1]</h2>
<p>Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.</p>
<p>This submission will eventually become your Data section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Data section) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.</p>
<h2>Applied Data Science Capstone Part 3 [Week 2]</h2>
<p>In this week, you will continue working on your capstone project. Please remember by the end of this week, you will need to submit the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A full report consisting of all of the following components:</li>
<li>Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.</li>
<li>Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.</li>
<li>Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.</li>
<li>Results section where you discuss the results.</li>
<li>Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.</li>
<li>Conclusion section where you conclude the report.</li>
<li>A link to your Notebook on your Github repository pushed showing your code. </li>
<li>Your choice of a presentation or blogpost. </li>
</ul>
